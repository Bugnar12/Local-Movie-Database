# Local-Movie-Database
Project done throughout the second semester at the OOP course. I consider it the project from where I learned the most, since it involved all the basic OOP concepts, but also specific C++ components such as templates and smart pointers. A GUI was implemented also using the QT framework, and other important ideas were used during the completion of this project (working with CSV and HTML files, various data structures, unit-testing with test coverage, refactoring).
